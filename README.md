### ABOUT OKBOOMER!
For everyone who thinks “cap” is just a hat – meet OKBOOMER! It turns your normal, everyday sentences into certified Gen Z bangers. Is it faster than googling? No. Is it cooler? Absolutely.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Why would anyone want to translate their text into Genz slang lol.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Using an app which does the same.
